## Introduction

Welcome to Intermediate Programming: JavaScript!

In order to succeed in this class, you will need access to a computer that can run a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (pretty much any computer can) and have a good internet connection. You should expect to spend about 12 hours a week on this class.

This class is a partially "flipped" class, so for on-campus students, half the class time will be instruction and the other half will be time to work on your lab assignmets with help from your instructor.

If you are an online student and have the class meeting time free, you can participate in class via Zoom, otherwise you can watch a recording of the instruction part of the class.

Read the rest of this page and the linked pages and then *let's have fun writing code!*
