<h1>Sample Project Self-Evaluation</h1>

[TOC]

## Introduction

This is an example of the self-evaluation you will submit along with the production version of your term project. You will need to start keeping a week-by-week log of your work at the beginning of the project. 

Document your progress as well as your development process as you work on each deliverable, week-by-week. You may want to include:

- A brief journal or blog-like narrative of your process.
- A brief summary of your satisfaction with your work and/or notes about what you would do differently in the future.
- The number of hours you spent completing the deliverable. 

  You may also want to keep a detailed log of what you're working on, when you work and how long you work on each "sub task" in each deliverable. Keeping track of that information will help you estimate how much time a task will take you in the future when you work.

## Sample Progress Log

### Week 6 - Overview

I started working on my project this week. I had an idea of what I wanted to do but I did spend a little bit of time looking at [https://www.programmableweb.com](https://www.programmableweb.com/) for other API that I might use. The hardest part of the deliverable for this week was the UI MockUp. I wanted to use a tool like Balsamiq but the learning curve was a little much for given the rest of my workload. I ended up using copy and paste from similar web pages to create my MockUp.

I spent about 4 hours this week.

### Week 7 – API

Working with API documentation is a little overwhelming. I find it hard to read the API documentation and decoding the API results JSON objects is complicated too. I had used both of the API in the weather app so I already had API keys and some idea how to get started.

I spent about 4 hours this week.

### Week 8 – Static HTML / CSS

I am not good at CSS! Creating the static HTML pages for sample content was not hard but getting the pages to look professional was really hard for me. I’m not happy with where I ended up but I know I can work on the look and feel more if I have time after I’ve completed the JavaScript.

I’m not really sure how do the static graphs, given that chart.js creates the graphs. I ended up creating the tabs like we did in the Event app for class and then hard coding the JSON objects for weather data and writing a tiny bit of JS code to make the charts show up on the page as you click the tabs.

I also set up the JS development environment this week. That basically means that I created a folder, copied and pasted the package.js and webpack.config.js files from the Event app for class, edited a couple of things and started working. Everything appears to be working ok so far.

I spent about 12 hours this week. Most of that time was CSS and I feel like I wasted a lot of time.

### Weeks 9 and 10 – JavaScript Implementation

The implementation was easier than I thought it would be, but I worked for a couple of hours every day and I asked a ton of questions. I was glad that I got good at debugging and at working with the debugger in the browser as I worked on the labs earlier in the term because I spent a TON of time debugging my JavaScript code. I was also glad that I spent time in each lab cleaning up and writing comments in my lab code. I was able to find sample code for lots of the things I had to do and understood the code well enough to modify it as a result.

At this point everything is working but the history feature. My app writes to local storage as the user enters a zip code or city/state but it doesn’t retrieve that information from local storage, display it on the page or allow the user to click on a location to get weather for that location directly.

I spent more time than I wanted cleaning up and documenting my code when I was finished with my implementation. In retrospect, I should have cleaned up my code every time I finished a feature. I think that would have saved me time in the long run.

I spent about 30 hours during the last 2 weeks working on JavaScript implementation.

## Summary

I spent a total of 50 hours on my project and am generally happy with it.

I learned: 

- The importance of reading and understanding API documentation, in spite of it being complex and hard to read. 
- CSS is still challenging and I need to improve my skills in this area. 
- More about JavaScript debugging and the importance of commenting and cleaning up code regularly&mdash; which saves time in the long run.

For future projects, I might consider spending more time upfront familiarizing myself with the tools and technologies I plan to use, such as Balsamiq for UI MockUp and CSS for styling. I might also want to improve my approach to working with APIs and handling JSON objects. Additionally, I would use a more systematic approach to debugging and maintaining my code, including regular cleanup and documentation after each feature is implemented.
