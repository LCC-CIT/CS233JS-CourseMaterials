<h1>Term Project Proposal</h1>

The objective of this first step in the project is to allow you to pick a  topic and identify the functionality that you would like your  application to provide.

- Watch the video that introduces the project.
- Read the project overview document.
- Write a paragraph or 2 describing the application you would like to build.  The application must make an AJAX call and you may find it helpful to  look at http://www.programmableweb.com to get an idea of some of the API that are available for programmers to use when building application.
- Create a "mock up" of the UI for the application. You may sketch the UI using paper and pencil or any of a number of UI MockUp tools. I often use  Balsalmiq with students and can provide you with a free student account  if you're interested.

- Create a word processing document that includes each of the requirements listed above.
- Share your document either formally or informally with at least one  other student in class. Revise the document based on feedback that you  think is relevant.
- Upload the document you created in moodle.
