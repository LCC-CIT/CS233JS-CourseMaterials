<h1>Term Project Requirements</h1>


## Objective
The objective of the term project is to allow you to synthesize your understanding of the concepts and skills introduced in the course as you work on a web-based application of your choice. Youâ€™ll begin to work on your project after the midterm quiz and will be working on your project exclusively during weeks 9 and 10. The project is worth roughly 20% of your grade for the term.

## Requirements
The project must:

- Include one or more web pages, have a clear objective and be user-friendly.

- Have a professional-looking UI that uses Bootstrap or another CSS framework with which you are familiar.
  
-  Use client-side code written in JavaScript. 
  
- Use classes for any parts of the project where it makes sense to use objects. Do not encapsulate the entire app in a single class.
  
- Separate the code that interacts with web page elements from the rest of the code.
  
- Include at least one AJAX request (call a web API).

- Include one or more of the other JS technologies introduced in the course such as: local storage, html canvas, regular expressions, chart.js, Google or Azure maps API.
  
- Be hosted on citstudent.lanecc.edu. 
  
- Production code should be transpiled to a version of JavaScript that can be interpreted by modern browsers.

## Submission

The project includes the following deliverables. Each deliverable has a due date to encourage you to work steadily on your project. There are samples of the first 2 deliverables as well as the code review form to give you a clearer understanding of expectations. These are the deliverables:

- Project proposal / description and UI Sketch/MockUp

- AJAX call documentation

- Static HTML / CSS implementation

- Beta version

- Code review

- Production version

See the [Term Project Instructions](CS233JS_ProjectInstructions.html) for details on each of these deliverables.
