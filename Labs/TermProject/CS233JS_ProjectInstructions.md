Each of the sections below are for a different deliverable.

# Project Proposal

The objective of this first step in the project is to allow you to pick a topic and identify the functionality that you would like your application to provide.

- Watch the video that introduces the project.
- Read the project overview document.
- Write a paragraph or 2 describing the application you would like to build.  The application must make an AJAX call and you may find it helpful to  look at [Public APIs Developers Can Use in Their Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/public-apis-for-developers/) to get an idea of some of the web APIs that are available to use in your project.
- Create a diagram of the UI for the application. You may sketch the UI using paper and pencil or any of a number of UI diagramming tools. I often use Balsalmiq with students and can provide you with a free student account if you're interested.

- Create a word processing document that includes each of the requirements listed above.
- Share your document either formally or informally with at least one other student in class. Revise the document based on feedback that you think is relevant.
- Upload the document you created in moodle.

# AJAX Call Documentation

The objective of this step in the project is to allow you to gather detailed information about the API you'll be using in your project. This should also help you refine the functionality of your application.

- Review the API calls from the bookmarker and weather application lab.
- Review the Sample API Calls Documentation document.
- Practice making the API call you'll make in code in your application. You may need to get an API key for the API. Document a sample URL for the API  and any parameters that your application may need to modify.
- Analyze the JSON results from the API call. Document the structure of the JSON object and identify any of the specific data that your application will need. Document the structure of the JSON response when an invalid API  call is made too.

- Create a word processing document that includes each of the requirements listed above.
- Share your document either formally or informally with your lab partner (or another student if your lab partner is not available). Revise the document based on feedback that you think is relevant.
- Upload the document you created to Moodle.
