## Lab Partner Teams

Each student is paired with one or two other students who are their lab partners. On Moodle, each team of lab partners is listed in a Moodle group as Team 1, Team 2, etc.

## Lab Assignment Versions

There are at least two versions of each lab assignment, assignment A, assignment B, etc. One lab partner will be given assignment A, the other will be given assignment B. This allows each student to look at the other’s work and give them feedback without seeing a solution to their own assignment.

## Giving and Getting a Code Review
 When a student has a beta (draft) version of their lab assignment ready, they will share it with their lab partner. This should be done before the due date for the beta version. 

Your instructor will provide you with a code review form. A lab partner will review the beta version and put *yes* or *no* in the "beta" column for each question on the code review form. This should be done before the due date for the code review. 

### What to Do with the Code Review You Give
 Share the code review for your lab partner <u>and</u> submit the it to your instructor using the Lab Review assignment link on Moodle.

### What to Do with the Code Review You Get
 After getting a code review, you may revise your lab work. Fill in the right-most column ("release" aka “production” column) of the review form to indicate any revisions. Fill in the right-most column completely, even if you didn’t change anything. Then, upload the final (aka release, or production) version of your lab work to Moodle along with the completed code review form for your own lab work.

## What to Do If Something Goes Wrong

### Your partner didn’t post a beta version by the deadline.

- Communicate with your partner and find out when they will have a beta version ready. Remind them that a beta version doesn’t need to be fully complete. Review their code for them when they post it. As long as you review your partner’s code before the due date for the final version, your review won’t be counted late.

- If you have already communicated with your code-review partner and they haven’t responded or have said they won’t be sharing code for review anytime soon, then you can do a code review for someone else. 

### Your partner didn’t do a review for you by the deadline. 

You can review your own code and put a note in the comments section saying your partner didn't give you a review by the deadline.

 

## FAQ

Q: Can I do a code review for someone else in addition to my lab partner?
A: Sure, it is good experience for you and helpful for the other person. They just need to have done a different assignment than the one you did.

Q: Can I get more than one code review for a particular lab?
 A: Sure, it’s fine for someone else, in addition to your lab partner, to review your code. As long as they didn’t do the same version of the assignment that you did.
