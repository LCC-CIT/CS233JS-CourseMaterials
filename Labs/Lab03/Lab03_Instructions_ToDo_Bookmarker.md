# Objectives

The objective of this lab is to give you more practice using the "new", widely supported,  version of JavaScript: ES6. You will also be introduced to Node.js, NPM and several other tools that are part of modern JavaScript development. 

# Instructions

Complete the programming web apps described in below. For each problem:

- Accept the invitation to the GitHub Classroom repository containing the starter files. Use Git and GitHub to manage your source code.
  **Important**: Do all your work in the Classroom repository working folder, don't make a different repository.
- Create a JavaScript solution that solves the problem. Test your solution in at least one browser running on your local machine.
- Upload your solution to citstudent.lanecc.edu. Test your solution running on the server in at least one browser.
- Evaluate your work using the code review form provided.

## 1. ToDo List

- Complete the ToDoList application described in the screencasts. The html and css files for the application have been provided in the starter GitHub repository. Add JavaScript code by following the detailed instructions in the starting .js file. Test and debug your application.
- Use Node, NPM, Webpack and Babel to create a production version of the  application "transpiled" to a version of JavaScript (ES5) that is supported by all browsers.

## 2. Web Page Bookmarker

- Complete the BookMarker application as described in the comments in the starting files for the application. Test and debug your application.
- Use Node, Npm, Webpack and Babel to create a production version of the  application "transpiled" to a version of JavaScript that is supported by all browsers.

  - Make a post in the Beta forum on Moodle letting your lab partner know you are read for a code review.
  - After your lab partner has made you a collaborator on their repository, do a code review for them using the code review form provided on Moodle.
  - Give your lab partner a copy of the code review by posting it in the forum.
- Submit your code reivew to Moodle
  - Submit a copy of the code review you did to the Moodle Code Review assignment.

## Production Version

- Publish to the CIT web server  
  - Upload your completed web apps to [citstudent.lanecc.edu](http://citstudent.lanecc.edu).  Test both apps on the web server.  

- Submit to Moodle
