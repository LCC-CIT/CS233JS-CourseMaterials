<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

[TOC]

# Objectives

The objective of this lab is to continue giving you practice using the "new" ES6 JavaScript features.  You will also get practice with CSS Flexbox (from CIS 195) and have your first experience with the HTML5 Canvas.  And, you will get further practice with webpack, webpack configuration files and the webpack development server.

# Instructions

Complete the Meme Creator web app:

- Accept the invitation to the GitHub Classroom repository containing the starter files. 
  **Important**: Do all your work in the Classroom repository working folder, don't make a different repository.

- Complete the Meme Creator application described in the screencasts and comments in the starter files.
  - Part 6 of the comments describes possible added functionality. Choose two features to add:
    - Allow the user to add text to the top of the meme
    - Allow the user to pick a font
    - Allow the user to pick a font color
    - Save the meme to local storage so that the last meme loads when the page loads
    -  Or something of your choice, but get approval from your instructor before implementing it.

  - For each of the 2 additional features:
    - Add html to the web page for the user to interact with.
    - Change the JS class to add event handlers to your new UI elements
    - Change the createMeme method to add your features to the canvas.

- Use Node, NPM, Webpack and Babel to create a production version of the  application "transpiled" to a version of JavaScript (ES5) that is supported by all browsers.
