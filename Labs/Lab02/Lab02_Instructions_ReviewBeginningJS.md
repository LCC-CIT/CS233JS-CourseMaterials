[TOC]

## Objectives

The objectives of this lab are:

1. Continue to Review JavaScript syntax you learned in CS 133JS.
2. Continue to learn Bootstrap.

## Part 1: W3 Schools Bootstrap Tutorial and Quiz

### Bootstrap 5 Intro



Do the eight [W3 Schools Bootstrap 5 Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/index.php) listed below.  
Be sure to sign in so that you can track your progress and submit a screen shot showing you completed the tutorials.

- Jumbotron  
  (skip alerts)
- Buttons
- Button Groups  
  (skip a bunch)
- Navs

Take the [W3 Schools Bootstrap 5 quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/bootstrap_quiz.php). There are 25 questions. For any questions you have difficulty answering or answer incorrectly, do or review the associated tutorial.

You will submit a screen-shot showing your final score after doing any tutorials and retaking the quiz. A score of 22 or higher will be considered 100% for this part of the lab assignment.



## Part 2: Web Apps

There are a few things Mari did differently than the way I would like you to do things:

- She hasn't introduced you to`let` and`const` yet, but you have learned about these in CS 133JS, so declare variables using `let` instead of `var`.
  - Use `const` to declare numbers that are used in the code:
    - In the concentration app, use a `const` for 20 (used once).
- Don't put multiple `return` statements in a function, for example in the branches of an if-else statement.

### Web App 1: Concentration - Version 1

- Download the staring file, [concentrationStart.zip](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KNRnDGB3kgBju57mHp5bfh0-K2ymcRGc?usp=sharing).
- Add JavaScript code to implement the concentration (aka memory) game functionality as you might have done in CS 133JS.  
- Add Bootstrap styles (as well as custom styles) to the starting files to create an attractive looking concentration board on the page. You can add as much or as little as you wish.
- Test and debug your application.
- You can try out a completed version of the web app here:

### Web App 2: TicTacToe - Version 1

- Download the staring file, [tttStart.zip](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tT6b64zk-Bs4WphFJc4wAylluqsy8wSk?usp=sharing).
- Add JavaScript code to implement the tic tac toe game functionality as you might have done in CS 133JS.
- Add Bootstrap styles (as well as custom styles) to the starting files to create an attractive looking tic tac toe board on the page. Again, add as much or little as you wish.
- Test and debug your application.
- You can try out a completed version of the web app here:

## Code Review

Do a review of your own code using the code review form posted on Moodle.



## Submission

- ### Publish to the CIT web server  

  Upload your completed web apps to [citstudent.lanecc.edu](http://citstudent.lanecc.edu).  Test the app on the web server to verify that it still works.  

  ### Upload to Moodle

  #### Moodle Lab 2 Code review assignment: 

  - Upload your completed code review form. This week you are just reviewing your own code.

  #### Moodle Lab 2 Production Version assignment:

  - Upload a screen-shot of your final score on the Bootstrap Quiz.
  - Upload a screen-shot of your Bootstrap tutorial progress.
