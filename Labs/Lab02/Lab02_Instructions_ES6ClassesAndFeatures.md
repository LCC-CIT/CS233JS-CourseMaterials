<h1>Lab 2: ES 6 Classes and Features</h1>

[TOC]

# Objectives

The objectives of this lab are:

1. Learn to write ES6 style classes and create objects from them
2. Introduce you to additional ES6 features.



# Instructions

### Set Up a GitHub Account

If you don’t already have a github account, create one now. Use your LCC email address. 

If you haven’t already installed Git on your computer, [download it](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it now.

### Clone the Repositories Containing Starting Files

Click the link to accept the GitHub Classroom assignment on Moodle. Choose your name from the GitHub Classroom roster, then follow any additional instructions. GitHub Classroom will create a private GitHub repository for you for this lab and will take you to the repository page on GitHub. 

Clone the repository to your local computer:

1. Click on the green "Code" button.
2. Copy the HTTPS address.
3. On your computer, in a terminal app (or GitBash, or PowerShell, or Command, etc.), at the folder where you want to clone the repository, type:  
   `git clone https://addressofyourrepository`

There is a separate folder for each of the three web apps.

**Tip**: As you finish each part of each web app, use the following Git commands to keep your Git repository up to date by *committing* and  *pushing* your code:

- git status
- git add –A
- git commit –m “some message”
- git push

After pushing, check your files on GitHub to make sure eveything is there.

## Web App 1: Stopwatch - Version 2

Refacotr the code for the stopwatch app so that it is all in one class. Use the comments in the starter file and Mari's video as a guide.

## Web App 2: Concentration - Version 2

Refactor the code for Concentration so that it is Object Oriented using three classes: Card, Board, and Game. Use the comments in the starting file and Brian's video as a guide.

## Web App 3: TicTacToe - Version 2

Refactor the code for TicTacToe to be Object Oriented using two classes: one to hold the game logic and the other to hold the i/o code that interacts with the HTML page.

## Beta Version and Code Review

- **Beta Version:** When your code is at least 75% done, [add your lab partner as a collaborator to your GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) and post a link to your repo in your team Discord channel with a  message to your lab partner letting them know they need to accept the invitation to your repo and that you are ready for a code review.

  - **What 75% done means**:  
    All the code is there and 75% of it is working. There could still be a  few errors that show up in the console and a few things that don't work yet.

  **Notes:** 

  - You don't need to submit the beta version anywhere, just share it with your lab partner to get a code review.
  - Everyone is doing the same lab assignment. You are **on your honor to not copy your lab partner's code** when you do the code revivew.

- **Code Review:** Do a code review for your lab partner using the code reveiw form for this lab and post the it in the Beta Version Forum for your lab partner as well as uploading it to the Moodle Code Review assignment. Use the provided .docx file for the code review (not a pdf) so your lab partner can edit the  "prod." column.



# Submission

## Publish to the CIT web server  
Upload your completed web apps to [citstudent.lanecc.edu](http://citstudent.lanecc.edu).  Put them in a directory named lab2 Test all 3 apps on the web server.  

- If you need to refresh your memory on how to do this, here are the instructions from the web authoring class: [How to upload web sites to citstudent](https://lcc-cit.github.io/CIS195-CourseMaterials/Lessons/UploadingWebSites.html).

## Upload to Moodle

- **Moodle Lab 2 Code review assignment**: upload your completed code review form. This week you are just reviewing your own code.
- **Moodle Lab 2 Production Version assignment:**  
  - Put the citstudent URLs for each web app in the online text.
  - Upload the code review your lab partner did for you with the "prod." column completed by you.
