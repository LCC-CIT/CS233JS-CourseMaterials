<h1>Lab 1: Review of Beginning JavaScript</h1>

[TOC]

# Objectives

The objectives of this lab are:

1. Learn to write ES6 style classes and create objects from them
2. Introduce you to additional ES6 features.



# Instructions

### Set Up a GitHub Account

If you don’t already have a github account, please create one now. Use your LCC
email address. 

If you haven’t already installed Git on your computer, [download it](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it now.

### Clone the Repositories Containing Starting Files

Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment on Moodle. This will create a private GitHub repository for you and will take you to the repository page on GitHub. Clone the repository to your local computer:

1. Click on the green "Code" button.
2. Copy the HTTPS address.
3. On your computer, in the folder where you want to clone the repository, at the command line, type:  
   `git clone https://addressofyourrepository`

There is a separate repository for each of the three web apps.

**Tip**: As you finish each part of each web app, use the following Git commands to keep your Git repository up to date by *pushing* your code:

- git status
- git add –A
- git commit –m “some message”
- git push

After pushing, check your files on GitHub to make sure eveything is there.

## Web App 1: Stopwatch - Version 2



## Web App 2: Concentration - Version 2

- Download the staring file, `concentrationStart.zip`.
- Add JavaScript code to implement the concentration (aka memory) game functionality as you might have done in CS 133JS.  
- Add Bootstrap styles (as well as custom styles) to the starting files to create an attractive looking concentration board on the page. You can add as much or as little as you wish.
- Test and debug your application.
- You can try out a completed version of the web app here: 
  [https://citstudent.lanecc.edu/~brianb/CS233JS/Lab01/concentration/](http://citstudent.lanecc.edu/~brianb/CS233JS/Lab01/concentration/)

## Web App 3: TicTacToe - Version 2

- Download the staring file, `tttStart.zip`.
- Add JavaScript code to implement the tic tac toe game functionality as you might have done in CS 133JS.
- Add Bootstrap styles (as well as custom styles) to the starting files to create an attractive looking tic tac toe board on the page. Again, add as much or little as you wish.
- Test and debug your application.
- You can try out a completed version of the web app here: 
  [https://citstudent.lanecc.edu/~brianb/CS233JS/Lab01/ticTacToe/](http://citstudent.lanecc.edu/~brianb/CS233JS/Lab01/ticTacToe/)



# Code Review

Do a review of your own code using the code review form posted on Moodle.



# Submission

## Publish to the CIT web server  
Upload your completed web apps to [citstudent.lanecc.edu](http://citstudent.lanecc.edu).  Test all 3 apps on the web server.  

- If you need to refresh your memory on how to do this, here are the instructions from the web authoring class: [How to upload web sites to citstudent](https://lcc-cit.github.io/CIS195-CourseMaterials/Lessons/UploadingWebSites.html).

## Upload to Moodle

- Moodle Lab 1 Code review assignment: upload your completed code review form. This week you are just reviewing your own code.
- Moodle Lab 1 Production Version assignment:  put the citstudent URLs for each web app in the online text.
