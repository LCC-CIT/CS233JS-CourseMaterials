- Upload your solution to citstudent.lanecc.edu. Test your solution running on the server in at least one browser.
- Use Git and GitHub to manage your source code and design documents. 
  **Important**: Do all your work in the working folders of your GitHub Classroom repositories. Don't make new repositories.
- Evaluate exchange code reviews or your work using with your lab partner.

## 1. Bookmarker Version 2

- Add an image as well as a title to each bookmark by accessing data  about each url from opengraph.io. The concepts, skills and syntax that  you need to make this change to your original application are discussed  in the lecture notes and will be demonstrated in class.
