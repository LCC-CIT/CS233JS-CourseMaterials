The objective of this lab is review JavaScript syntax that you learned in CS 133JS as well as to introduce you to Bootstrap, a CSS framework.

Complete the programming problems described below.  For each problem:

- Create a JavaScript solution that solves the problem.  Test your solution in at least one browser running on your local machine.
- Upload your solution to citstudent.lanecc.edu.  Test your solution running on the server in at least one browser.
- Evaluate your work using the code review form provided.

Design and implement a JavaScript solution to each of the following problems:

1. StopWatch - Version 1

   - Add Bootstrap styles (as well as custom styles) to the starting files to create an attractive looking stop watch on the page.  A sample illustration has been provided in the starting files.
