/*  Overview
    This application simulates a concentration or memory game of 20 cards.
    The game begins with 20 (10 pairs of 2) cards "face down" on the board.
    The user clicks 2 cards at a time.  The cards are displayed "face up".
    After a brief pause the cards are removed from the board if they match
    or are turned "face down" if they are not.  The game is over when the 
    user has cleared all 20 cards from the board.

    There are 6 global variables that are used to keep track of the "state"
    of the application.
    -  imagePath - the folder where the cards are stored
    -  images - an array of 20 card file names
    -  firstPick - the 0 based index of the first card picked by the user
    -  secondPick - the 0 based index of the 2nd card picked by the user
    -  matches - the number of matches the user has removed from the board so far
    -  tries - the number of pairs of cards the user has selected so far

    The function handleClick is associated with the click event handler for each card.

    There are lots of  "helper" functions.  Comments in the code describe each of these functions.
    I've written more functions that I might have done to make each function as simple as possible.
