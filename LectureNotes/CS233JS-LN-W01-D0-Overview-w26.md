[TOC]

## Introduction

- This class is a partially "flipped" class, meaning you will watch video lectures and coding demos before class (these were recorded by Mari Good), and in class, I'll do some teaching, but give you a lot of time to <u>code and get help with debugging</u>.  

- Be sure to watch or read <u>all the required materials</u> on Moodle.  
  For online students, this includes the class recordings which will be available after my office hours on class days via the <u>Zoom recordings</u> page which will be linked near the top of the Moodle page.

## Announcements

- **No-show/drop**
  Be aware of LCC's <u>no-show/drop</u> policy. You need to come to class once during the first week, or take the quiz in order to not be automatically dropped!
  
- **Last day for a refund** 
   Monday, Jan 12, is the last day to get a refund if you drop a class.
   
- **Web server credentials**  
   We will be using the citstudent web server, the same one you used in your HTML and CSS class (and possibly in Beginning JavaScript). I'll be sending out login credentials early this week, or you can use your old login.
