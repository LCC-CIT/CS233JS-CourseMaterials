## More on JS Dev Tools

This week you will be workining with the same JS web dev tools you used last week:

### Node.js and NPM

- The lab 5 `package.json` will have the same kinds of things in it as lab 4.
- Type: `npm install` to install all the node modules.

### Webpack

This week you'll learn more about using Wepack.

- `webpack.config.json`
  The lab 5 version of this file has more kinds of things in it.
  - Type: `npm run build` to build (transpile and bundle) the project and create the `dist` folder.
  
- `dist` folder
  In lab 5 you'll learn more about how the bundled code is generated.
  - `memes.bundle.js`&mdash;contains all the .js and .css code bundled into one big file.
    - This file is linked to `index.html` by a `<script>` element at the bottom of the html file.
    - This file is a lot bigger than the sum of your .js and .css source files, but a lot smaller than the sum of the node modules.  
      Questiion: Why do you think this is?
  - `memes.bundle.js.map`&mdash;maps the dist JS code to the src JS code so you can debug your JS code in a web browser.



#### Benefits of Using Webpack

  Webpack offers several benefits for JavaScript development:

  1. **Module Bundling**: Webpack is a module[^1] bundler that creates a dependency graph of all your project's modules. It starts from an entry point and follows all the dependencies to know what it has to bundle.
  2. **Loaders**: Webpack uses loaders to convert different types of files like images and CSS into modules before adding them to the dependency graph.
  3. **Plugins**: Plugins in Webpack provide additional functionality, such as printing something on running the webpack, minifying, and optimizing bundles.
    4. **Code Splitting**: Webpack supports a module system that allows you to split your code into different modules. This means you can use one file's features in another, despite having different files.
  5. **Minification**: Webpack provides minification, which reduces file size and minimizes the code. It removes all the whitespace, line breaks, and unnecessary code, and changes long variable names.
  6. **Development Speed**: Webpack can speed up the development process. If you're using Webpack, your page does not need to fully reload when there's a small change in JavaScript. This benefit can also be accessed for CSS if you use loaders. It also reduces the load time of the website during debugging.
  7. **Avoids Global Variable Overwriting**: Since Webpack provides a module system based on ECMAScript (ES6), every file you create will become a module. Hence, every variable you create in this file will be in the local scopeÂ¹. This solves the problem of overwriting global variables.
  8. **Feature Flagging**: Webpack supports feature flagging, a software engineering approach by which you can send code to different environments during feature testing.

Note: Webpack only understands JavaScript and JSON. So, it converts other frontend files like HTML and CSS into modules with the help of a loader.

#### Dev Server

Run the development server with `npm run watch`  
(This doesn't rebuild the code in the dist folder, the server puts rebuilt code in memory.)
