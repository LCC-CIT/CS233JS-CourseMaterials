# Introduction

This week you are refactoring the three web apps from last week to use classes for object oriented programming reather than procedural programming.

# Object Oriented Programming

## Classes and Objects

### Why use classes?

- To make code easier to reuse.
- To group together methods and variables that are related to eachother so that code is easier to understand.
- To make refactoring easier by reducing dependencies.

### How are classes and objects related?

- A class is like a template or a cookie cutter it is used to make objects.
- Objects (also called instances of a class) are what get executed. Many objects can be made from one class.  
  Exception: next week you will learn about static methods and variables which can be used directly in a class wihtout making an object.

### What does `this` refer to?

JavaScript has something called a *lexical this*. It's pretty diffeent from most other programming languages. The `this` keyword means different things in different contexts:

- In class, it will refer to the object that is created by the class. The significance of it relating to the object and not the class is that there can be many objects made from a class.
- In a method (or function) that is an event handler, it refers to the HTML element that generated the event. For example a `<div>` or a `<button>` 
- In a method (or function) that is used a callback, it refers to the object that called it. For example, in the stopwatch app, you pass a callback function, `incrementTimer`,  to the `setInterval` function. Inside `incrementTimer`, `this` refers to the browser's window object since `setInterval` is a global function.

### When do you need to use `bind`?

If you want a method's `this` to refrence a different object than the default one, you can use bind to change the object that `this` will refer to inside that method. For example, in the stopwatch app, `startButton` is called by a button's  onclick event. By default, inside `startButton`, `this` will refer to the button, but by using `bind` we can force `this` to refer to an object of the stopwatch class.

``` javascript
this.startButton.onclick = this.startTimer.bind(this);
```

## Classes that Contain Objects of Other Classes

- This is called composition.
- It is the way to build an application using multiple objects where each object represents a "thing" in the application.
- Classes should be "highly coherent" and "loosely coupled".

## Separation of Concerns

In order to make your code easy to test, debug and update (add features), it is good to separate parts of the app that do different things from each other; like i/o and processing. 

### Example: The Concentration Game

This game can be refactored to have these classes:

- Card
- Board
- Game

The Board class will have Card objects in it and the Game class will have a Board object in it.

In order to follow the principle of separation of concerns, we can separate out the i/o (everything that has to do with the html page) from the processing. In order to do this:

- The Card class will just work with letters that represent suit and value rather than directly using card images.
- The Board class won't have any event listeners or any code that interacts with the html page in it.
- The Game class will be the only class that interacts with the html page.
