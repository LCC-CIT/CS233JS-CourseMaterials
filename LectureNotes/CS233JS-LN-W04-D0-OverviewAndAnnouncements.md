### Class participation

- If you are an on campus or online student who can join us during class time, I encourage you to come to the classroom or join us on Zoom.
- If you are an online student be sure to <u>watch the video recordings</u> of the in-class lectures. Access these via the Zoom Meetings and Recordings link near the top of the Moodle page.
