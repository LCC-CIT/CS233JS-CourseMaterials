## Objectives

- To introduce you to commonly used JavaScript development tools including Node.js, Babel, and Webpack.

- To introduce you to using the web browser's LocalStorage for storing client-side data.

- To develop your proficiency in designing, implementing, testing and debugging JavaScript web apps.

## Things to do this week

- Review this week's section on Moodle. 
- Be sure to <u>watch or read all the required materials linked on Moodle</u>.  
    For online students, this includes the short class recordings which will be available after 4:00 on Monday and Wednesday via the Zoom widget near the top of the Moodle page.

- This week's class will be more "flipped", meaning I won't lecture very much, instead I'll give you a lot of time to <u>code and get help with debugging</u>.
- Things that have changed since Mari recorded her videos:

  - This week's lab was lab 3 but is now lab 4.
  - Browser compatibility with ES6 used to be an issue, but now all browsers support ES6 and even newer version of JavaScript as well. 
  - The link to the browser compatibility chart in Mari's notes is now broken. Here's a replacement: [ECMAScript Browser Compatibility Table](https://compat-table.github.io/compat-table/es6/).


### Lab 4

- Read the instructions
- Accept the GitHub Classroom invitation for lab 4
- Look at the code review form

### Due dates

- Tuesday: The code review for Lab 3 (last week's lab).
  (The beta version was due Sunday.)
- Thursday: 
  - Reading quiz 4.
  - Lab 3 production version.
- Sunday:
  - Share a beta version of lab 4 with your lab partner.  
    Add your lab partner to your repository and let them know in your team channel on Discord.

## Midterm quiz next week

- On campus students (Hybrid modality) will take the midterm at class time on Wednesday, 2/5, in the classroom.
- Online students will take the midterm at [Instructional Testing Services](https://www.lanecc.edu/get-support/academic-support/instructional-testing-services), located in the Center building, room 311 (on the third floor). 
  - The quiz will be open Wednesday, 2/5 through Saturday, 2/8. See the Instructional Testing web site for their hours.
  - **Please note that ID is required.** <u>If you don't have ID let your instructor know in advance</u>.
  - **If you live outside the Eugene/Springfield area** and do not want to come to the LCC campus to take the final, you need to send an email to [online@lanecc.edu](mailto:online@lanecc.edu) and copy birdb@lanecc.edu well in advance of the test date to arrange for your quiz to be proctored at a location near you.

## Reminders

### Getting Help

#### Office Hours

I have drop-in office hours on [Zoom](https://lanecc.zoom.us/j/93494931394) and in person, building 19, room 152, Monday through Thursday from 1:00 to 1:50. I'm available at other times too, just let me know when you'd like to meet. 

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions, would like help debugging code, or anything else!

#### Tutoring

There are tutors available in the CIT Lab, building 19, room 135, or [online](https://www.lanecc.edu/get-support/academic-support/academic-and-tutoring-services).

Ask questions in the class [Discord Discussion channel](https://discord.com/channels/1290812758249701396/1324897172981809273). I'll answer questions pretty quickly on weekdays, often on Saturday and sometimes on Sunday. Other students will often help you too!

### Class participation

- If you are an online student be sure to <u>watch the video recordings</u> of the short, in-class, lectures. Access these via the Zoom Meetings and Recordings link near the top of the Moodle page.

**You will get more out of this class if you come or Zoom to class where you can get help with your lab assignments!**
