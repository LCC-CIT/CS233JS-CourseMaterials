# FAQs

## 1. What is Webpack?
Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. It recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module your application needs, then packages all of those modules into one or more bundles.

### Why use Webpack?

 Webpack simplifies the management of dependencies and provides a modular approach to web application development. It also optimizes the size and performance of application bundles.

### How do I install Webpack?

You can install Webpack using npm with the command `npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli`.

## 2. What is `webpack.config.js`?
`webpack.config.js` is a configuration file for Webpack. It’s where you define rules, plugins, entry and output paths, and other configuration details for your Webpack build.

### Can I have multiple configuration files?

Yes, you can have multiple configuration files for different environments or purposes, such as `webpack.config.dev.js` for development and `webpack.config.prod.js` for production.

## 3. What are loaders in Webpack?

Loaders in Webpack transform the source code of a module.  They allow you to preprocess files as you `require()` or “load” them. For example, `babel-loader` allows you to use ES6 features by transforming them into ES5 code that can run in current browsers.

### How do I use loaders in Webpack?

Loaders can be used in the `module.rules` section of your `webpack.config.js` file. Each rule specifies a test and a loader, where the test is a regular expression that matches the file types the loader should process.

## 4. What are plugins in Webpack?

Plugins are the backbone of Webpack. They serve the purpose of doing anything that loaders cannot do. They can perform a wide range of tasks like bundle optimization, asset management, and environment variables injection.

### How do I use a plugin in my Webpack configuration?
Plugins can be used by requiring them at the top of your `webpack.config.js` file, then adding a new instance of the plugin to the `plugins` array in your configuration.

## 5. What is an entry point in Webpack?

The entry point is the module that Webpack uses to start building out its internal dependency graph. By default, the entry point is `./src/index.js`, but you can specify a different module in your `webpack.config.js` file.

### How do I set up Webpack for multiple entry points?

You can specify multiple entry points in the `webpack.config.js` by providing an object with key-value pairs, where keys are the entry names and values are the entry file paths.

## 6.  What is an output in Webpack?

The output property tells Webpack where to emit the bundles it creates and how to name these files.

## 7. What is `mode` in Webpack configuration?

The `mode` configuration option tells Webpack to use its built-in optimizations accordingly. It can be set to `none`, `development` or `production`.

## 8. How do I handle HTML in Webpack?

To handle HTML in Webpack, you canuse the `html-webpack-plugin` to copy HTML files to the `dist` folder. You'll need a plugin object for each HTML file.

## 9. How do I handle CSS in Webpack?

You can handle CSS in Webpack using the `style-loader` and `css-loader`. The `css-loader` interprets `@import` and `url()` like `import/require()` and will resolve them, while the `style-loader` injects CSS into the DOM.

## 10. How do I handle assets like images in Webpack?
You can handle images in Webpack using the `file-loader` or `url-loader`. These loaders allow you to `import` image files in your JavaScript modules and use them like any other asset. Webpack can also handle fonts, and other assets using `file-loader` and `url-loader`, which process these files and include them in the output bundle.

## 11. How do I optimize my Webpack build? 

You can optimize your Webpack build by using plugins like `UglifyJsPlugin` for minification, `SplitChunksPlugin` for chunk splitting, and setting `mode` to ‘production’ for enabling optimizations out of the box.

## 12. What is Tree Shaking in Webpack? 

Tree Shaking is a feature that allows Webpack to remove unused code from your bundle, resulting in a smaller bundle size.



# Example

Here is an example webpack.config.js file

```javascript
const path = require('path');
// webpack dev server will serve files on localhost:8080 by default
const htmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const copyPlugin = require("copy-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: '[name].bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(?:js|mjs|cjs)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: [
              ['@babel/preset-env', { targets: "defaults" }]
            ]
          }
        }
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      }
    ]
  },
plugins: [
  new htmlWebpackPlugin({
    template: "./index.html"
  }),
  new copyPlugin({
    patterns: [
      {
        from: path.resolve(__dirname, "./images"),
        to: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist/images"),
      }
    ],
  })
],
  devtool: 'inline-source-map',
    devServer: {
  static: './dist',
  },
optimization: {
  runtimeChunk: 'single',
  }
};
```
