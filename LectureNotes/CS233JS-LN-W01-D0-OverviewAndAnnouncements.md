<h2>Contents</h2>

[TOC]

## Introduction

- This class is a "flipped" class, meaning you will watch video lectures and coding demos before class (these were recorded by Mari Good), and in class, I'll give you a lot of time to <u>code and get help with debugging</u>.  

  But, This first week I'll be doing more direct instruction since you won't have had a chance to watch Mari's videos before the first class.

- Be sure to watch or read <u>all the required materials</u> on Moodle.  
  For online students, this includes the class recordings which will be available after 1:00 on Monday and Wednesday via the <u>Zoom recordings</u> page linked near the top of the Moodle page.

## Announcements

- **No-show/drop**
  Be aware of LCC's <u>no-show/drop</u> policy. You need to come to class once during the first week, or take the quiz in order to not be automatically dropped!
- **Last day for a refund** 
   Monday, April 7, is the last day to get a refund if you drop a class.
- **Web server credentials**  
   You will be getting an email sometime this week from `citlab@lanecc.edu` with your username and password for one of our department's web servers, `citweb.lanecc.net`.

## This Week: Course Intro, JS Review and Bootstrap

### Objectives
