## Introduction

- Review this week's section on Moodle. 
- Be sure to <u>watch or read all the required materials</u>.  
    For online students, this includes the short class recordings which will be available after 1:00 on Monday and Wednesday via the Zoom recordings page linked near the top of the Moodle page.
- This week's classes will be more "flipped", meaning I won't lecture very much, instead I'll give you a lot of time to <u>code and get help with debugging</u>.
- Things that have changed since Mari recorded her videos:

  - The way grading is done and the course structure.


## Lab 1

- Read the instructions
- Look at the code review form

## Due dates

Look at the due dates in the "Upcoming Events" section of the Moodle right-hand flyout.



## Reminders

### Getting Help

#### Office Hours

I have drop-in office hours on [Zoom](https://lanecc.zoom.us/j/97305128975) and in person, building 19, room 152, Monday through Thursday from 4:00 to 4:50. I'm available at other times too, just let me know when you'd like to meet. 

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions, would like help debugging code, or anything else!

#### Tutoring

There are tutors available in the CIT Lab, building 19, room 135, or [online](https://www.lanecc.edu/get-support/academic-support/academic-and-tutoring-services).

#### Discord

Ask questions in the class [Discussion channel](https://discord.com/channels/1290812758249701396/1324897172981809273). I'll answer questions pretty quickly on weekdays, often on Saturday and sometimes on Sunday. Other students will often help you too!

### Class Participation

- If you are an on campus or online student who can join us during class time, then come to the classroom (building 19, room 128) or [join us on Zoom](https://lanecc.zoom.us/j/96377530587).
- If you are an online student be sure to <u>watch the video recordings</u> of the short, in-class, lectures. Access these via the Zoom widget near the top of Moodle.

**You will get more out of this class if you come or Zoom to class where you can get help with your lab assignments!**
