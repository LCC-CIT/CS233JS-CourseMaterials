## Open Graph

**TODO: Revise this, it's from AI**

The Open Graph protocol is a set of meta tags added to a webpage that allows it to become a rich object in a social network. It was originally developed by Facebook and is now used by many social media platforms. Here’s a bit more detail:

- **Purpose**: The Open Graph protocol standardizes the use of metadata within a webpage to represent the content of the page. This allows the page to be the same as other objects on social media, like photos or videos.
- **Usage**: By adding Open Graph tags to the HTML of your webpage, you can determine what information is displayed when your webpage is shared on social media. This can include the title, description, image, and more.
- **Benefits**: Using the Open Graph protocol enhances the visibility of your content on social media and encourages click-throughs by providing a rich preview of your content.
- **Requirement**: At a minimum, you should include basic Open Graph tags like `og:title`, `og:type`, `og:image`, and `og:url` in your webpage’s HTML for effective previews on social media.

In summary, the Open Graph protocol helps webpages become part of the social graph on the internet, providing a richer user experience when content is shared on social media.
