## This Week: More on AJAX and Making API Calls

### Objectives

- to further develop your understanding of ES6 promises and the fetch API.
- to introduce you to using chart.js to create graphs in a web application.
- to introduce you to using a maps API (Google or Azure maps) to create maps in a web application.
- to further develop your proficiency in designing, implementing,  testing and debugging client-side applications that make AJAX calls in  JavaScript.

### Changes Since Mari's Videos Were Made

- This week's lab, lab 7, was lab 6 when Mari made her videos.  
This is the last lab assignment for this term!
- The link to the article, "Create a rest api with json-server" is no longer there. Instead you can read this article/tutorial: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/json-server-for-frontend-development/

### Starting the Term Project

This week, you are starting your term project. [Read the requirements here](../Labs/TermProject/CS233JS_ProjectRequirements.html).

You will be making submissions at each step in the project, as shown below.

Steps 1 through 3 are to prepare you to do the project. Step 4 is where you will do most of the work, you will do this weeks 9 and 10 when there will be no new lab assignments.
