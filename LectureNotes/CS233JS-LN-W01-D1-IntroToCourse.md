# Introduction

## Description to the Course

You will continue learing to develop client-side (aka front-end) code for browser-based applications. The course introduces intermediate level programming concepts and skills and shows you how to implement them in JavaScript. This course also teaches you how to use modern JavaScript tools and frameworks. 

### Prerequisites

- CIS 195, Web Authoring
- CS 133JS, Beginning Programming JavaScript

### Programs Using this Course

- AAS in Software Development (required)
- Career Pathway Certificate in Front End Web Development (required)
- AAS in Cybersecurity (program elective)
- AAS in Computer Network Operations (program elective)

## Teaching Style and Modality

This is my (Brian) second time teaching this course. The course materials were developed by Mari Good, who is now retired; most of the videos and teaching materials are hers. 

Note that my grading rubrics and class policies are different from hers. Ignore anyting in her videos about these things, just pay attention to what she says about programming.

I will be partially adapting my teaching approach to her materials. Here's what this means for you:

#### For on-campus students

This class will be more of a "flipped" class. This means that you will watch tutorial videos before class, then during class time, I will do less lecturing and I will spend more time helping you with your lab assignments.

The first week will be an exception, I will do more teaching in class, to get you started, but for the rest of the term you will be reading and watching videos made by Mari (and some by me) before class. Then in class you can ask questions and get help with your labs.

#### For online students

The main difference from last term is that you will be watching short tutorial videos instead of the long class lecture recordings I made for my previous online classes.

You can still join the class live via Zoom so that you can ask questions and get help while you are working on your lab assignments. And, you are welcome to come to class in person if your schedule allows it.

# Course Tour

- [Syllabus](../CS233JS_Syllabus.html) – quick overview
- Reading, tutorial videos and quizzes
  
  - Purpose of quizzes isn’t testing, it’s learning and accountability.
- Lab assignments
  
  - For the first problem in each assignment, Mari will walk you through the solution. For the rest of the problems, you will solve them partially, or completely on your own.
  
  - You will upload your solutions (web apps) to [citstudent](http://citstudent.lanecc.edu), and post the URL and a code review on [Moodle](https://classes.lanecc.edu).
- Code reviews
  - Each lab assignment (except lab 1) has a beta and production version. Code reviews are done on the beta version.
  - Reasons we do code reviews:
    - They help you improve the quality of your code.
    - You learn from seeing how other people solve problems.
    - They are used by development teams in the real world.
  
  - You will be assigned the same lab partner(s) you had last term, unless you would like to make a change, let me know if you would like a different lab partner.
  - Look at the code review guide (there's a link in the Moodle page fly-out).
