## Notes and Corrections

### Home Page

Notice that when you submit the form, the data is saved in the db.json file.

### Status Page

#### Tabs

Tabs are made with Bootstrap (which makes them using fancy CSS) and are actually HTML list item elements, `<li>`.  They get event listeners that listen for click events.

The method `loadExperience` in the video is now named `showExperience` in the `status.js` starter file. The `showExperience` method calls `createExperienceChart`;
