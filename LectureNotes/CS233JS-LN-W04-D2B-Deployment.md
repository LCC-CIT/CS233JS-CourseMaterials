# Production Code and Deployment

Webpack dev server keeps transplied code in memory, but doesn't put it in dist

Mari explained some of web pack.config.js

`npm run build` transpiles the code with output in the dist folder

**Upload just the files inside the dist folder to citstduent!**

FYI, when pushing to GitHub, the .gitignore file has node_modules listed as a folder to ignore.



# Bookmarker app for Lab 3

`npm install` to install the node modules for the Bookmarker project
