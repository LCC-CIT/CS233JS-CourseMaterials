### Lab 4 GitHub Classroom Starter Files

For some reason the src/js folder didn't get included in the BookMarkerStart and ToDoListStart folders in the Lab 4 GitHub Classroom repositories that you downloaded. I've tried to add those for you via GitHub Classroom, but it doesn't seem to be working. You'll need to just download the files from here and add the js folders yourselves. Let me know if you have questions or need help doing this.

## This Week's Learning Objectives
