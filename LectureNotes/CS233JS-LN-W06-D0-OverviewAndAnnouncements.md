## Last Week

### Midterm

- Most of you did pretty well. The average score was 77% and the median was 81%.
- There were some multiple choice questions with multiple correct answers that didn't correctly calculate partial credit. I have fixed those and your grades have been re-calculated.

### Lab 4

This was due last Thursday, but it was the week of the midterm and most of you didn't get it finished yet.

- What questions to you have?
- Don't hesitate to ask for help!



## This Week

### Objectives

- To develop your proficiency in using JavaScript development tools.
- To introduce you to the canvas object and to the API for working with the canvas in JavaScript.
- To develop your proficiency in designing, implementing,  testing and debugging client-side web-based applications written in JavaScript.

### Notes on Mari's Videos and Starting Code

  - Mari refers to this week's lab as "lab 4" but it is now lab 5.
  - In the lab 5 instructions, I provided an alternate way to set the size of images that you upload.
  - Mari made a video on CSS Flexbox, which is not related to the HTML 5 canvas, but is used for layout of the lab 5 meme creator web page. This was probably covered in your CIS 195 course and so it will be review.
