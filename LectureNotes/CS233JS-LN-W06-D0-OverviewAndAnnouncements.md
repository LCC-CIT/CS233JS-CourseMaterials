## Announcements

- Our CIT lab mamager, Jacob Riddle, would like to have a movie/game day in the lab on Friday, February 28 from 11 am- 4:30 pm. Please share your interest by completing [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHS7OqR-gNMZnzU8EVZFsU_8qwEzT8YcbBLJlREReCd_x47A/viewform).

## Last Week

### Midterm

- Most of you did pretty well. The average score was 77% and the median was 81%.
- There were some multiple choice questions with multiple correct answers that didn't correctly calculate partial credit. I have fixed those and your grades have been re-calculated.

### Lab 4

This was due last Thursday, but it was the week of the midterm and most of you didn't get it finsihed yet.

- What questions to you have?
- Don't hesitate to ask for help!

## This Week

- Review this week's section on Moodle. 
- Be sure to <u>watch or read all the required materials</u>.  
    For online students, this includes the short class recordings which will be available after 4:00pm on Monday and Wednesday via the Zoom widget near the top of the Moodle page.
- Notes regarding Mari's videos:

  - Mari refers to this week's lab as "lab 4" but it is now lab 5.
  - There is a video on CSS Flexbox, which is not related to the HTML 5 canvas, but is used for layout of the lab 5 meme creator web page. This was probably covered in your CIS 195 course and so it will be review.

### Lab 5

You'll be making one web app, a meme creator.

- Read the instructions.
  - Note that there is a link to Brian's finished Meme Maker app running on citstudent.

- Accept the GitHub Classroom for lab 5
- Look at the code review form

### Due dates

- Tuesday: Lab 4 code review, if you didn't already do one.
- Thursday: 
  - Reading quiz 5.
  - Lab 4 production version, if you didn't already submit it.
- Sunday:
  - Share a beta version of lab 5 with your lab partner.  
    Add your lab partner to your repository and let them know in your team channel on Discord.
