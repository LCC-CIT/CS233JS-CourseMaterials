## This Week

### Objectives

- to introduce you to asynchronous communication and the usage of AJAX to combine client-side and server-side processing
- to introduce you to ES6 promises
- to introduce you to the fetch API and async / await
- to develop your proficiency in implementing, testing and debugging client-side applications that make AJAX calls in JavaScript

### Notes on Mari's Videos and Starting Code

  - This week's lab, lab 6 (bookmarker version 2 and a weather app) was lab 5 when Mari made the video.
  - We won't use Babel (although using it won't hurt anything)
  - Instead of promise chaining with `.then`, we'll use `async` / `await`.
