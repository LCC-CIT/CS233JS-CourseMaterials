## Course Description

This is the second in a sequence of 2 courses that teaches students to develop client-side or front-end code for browser-based applications. The course introduces intermediate level programming concepts and skills as well as JavaScript syntax, tools and frameworks required for modern front-end development.

## Learning Outcome

The intention of the course is to enable you to use modern technologies and tools to create more advanced front-end components that might be part of any web site.

### Teaching Methods

This hybrid course accommodates on-campus and online students through a blend of lectures, discussions, and hands-on labs. Online students can participate synchronously via Zoom or asynchronously by watching session recordings.

Students will work with lab partners to do code reviews and provide helpful feedback for improving each other’s code quality. Online students can collaborate with their lab partners asynchronously.

## Learning Resources

There is no textbook required for the course. The content of the course centers on the development of several more advanced web applications using modern features of JavaScript. In the process of building the applications the course will illustrate the usage of JavaScript modules, libraries and frameworks that are typical of a modern JavaScript development environment. Your instructor will provide written and video tutorials on a variety of topics. Screencasts that demonstrate all the concepts and skills required for completion of each lab will also be provided. Starting files for each lab assignment will be provided on GitHub beginning with the second lab.

## Assessment and Grading

The table below summarizes the possible points for each assessment task as well as the course as a whole:

| **Assessment Tasks**      | **Points Each**          | **Total Points** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Labs 1–7                  | 50                       | 350              |
| Code Reviews 1–7          | 10                       | 70               |
| Quizzes 1–7               | 10                       | 70               |
| Term Project              | 210                      | 210              |
| Midterm and Final Quizzes | Midterm: 100, Final: 200 | 300              |
| **Course Total**          |                          | **1000**         |

Letter grades for the course will be determined by the following percentages:

|       | **+**     |          | **-**    |
| ----- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| **A** | 100 to 98 | 97 to 92 | 91 to 90 |
| **B** | 89 to 88  | 87 to 82 | 81 to 80 |
| **C** | 79 to 78  | 77 to 72 | 71 to 70 |
| **D** | 69 to 68  | 67 to 62 | 61 to 60 |
| **F** | Below 60  |          |          |

### Quizzes

#### Weekly Quizzes

Weekly quizzes are given that cover the required reading and tutorial videos for that week. They are "open book" (or video).

#### Midterm and Final Quizzes

The midterm and final quizzes are given in weeks 5 and 11. See the course schedule for exact dates and times. Quizzes are "closed book", but students may prepare a 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of notes to refer to during the quiz. These quizzes may be taken either:

- On-campus students (hybrid modality) will take the quiz in the classroom during the normal class time.
- Online students will take the quiz in the Instructional Testing Center in the Center Building, room 311. See the [Instructional Testing Services](https://www.lanecc.edu/get-support/academic-support/instructional-testing-services) web site for testing times and procedures.

### Code Reviews

Students will work in groups of two or three, to review the *beta* versions of each other’s lab assignment solutions. The code review does not affect the grade of the student whose work is being reviewed.

### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work.

#### Use of AI

Generative AI tools such as GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT are useful resources and you are encouraged to use them to help you learn how to code,  but not to do the coding for you unless a specific assignment has instructions that include using AI to assist with writing your code.

If students submit code that uses JavaScript features or programming techniques that are more advanced or different from what was taught in class, the student will need to demonstrate that they actually wrote the code themselves and understand how it works.

### Participation and Attendance

While participation and attendance are essential to succeed in this class, they will not be graded.

### No Show Drop

The college’s “no show, drop” policy requires that: during the first week students must complete at least one activity (a quiz or assignment) otherwise the student will be dropped from the class.

### Late Work

- Grades for lab production versions submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10%.
- No late assignments may be submitted after the end of week 10.
- Code reviews, quizzes and exams cannot be taken after the due date.
