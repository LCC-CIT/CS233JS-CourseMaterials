# Example of Calling an Open Graph Web API

This web site provides an example of using the built-in JavaScript fetch function to call the [linkpreview](https://linkpreview.net) web API to get Open Graph data from a web site.

To run this on your local machine, you need to use a web server.
If you try to open this web page directly from the file system of your local machine you will get this error : 
`[Error] Not allowed to load local resource`
This is because most browsers block loading local resources for security reasons.
