[W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp) - One of the best places to learn the basics of JavaScript. Unfortunately, Warning: this site sometimes contains advertising that I (Brian) consider objectionable.

[JavaScriptTutorial.net](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/) - A well written and organized set of tutorials. The advertising on this site appears to be benign.
