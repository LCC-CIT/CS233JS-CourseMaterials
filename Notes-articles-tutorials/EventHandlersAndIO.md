From GitHub Copilot, 2/12/25:

There are several conventions related to UI code in JavaScript that can help improve readability and maintainability. Here are a few common ones:

1. **Prefixing DOM Elements with `$`**: As mentioned, prefixing variables that reference DOM elements with `$` is a common convention.

   this.$button = document.querySelector('#button');

2. **Using `camelCase` for Variable and Function Names**: JavaScript conventionally uses `camelCase` for naming variables and functions.

   let userName = 'John';

   function updateUserName() { ... }

3. **Event Handler Naming**: Prefix event handler functions with `handle` or `on` to indicate their purpose.

   function handleButtonClick(event) { ... }

   function onButtonClick(event) { ... }

4. **Class Names in `PascalCase`**: Use `PascalCase` for naming classes.

   class MemeGenerator { ... }

5. **Constants in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`**: Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.

   const DEFAULT_IMAGE_SRC = 'path/to/image.jpg';

6. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep your JavaScript, HTML, and CSS separate to maintain a clear structure. Use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, CSS for styling, and HTML for structure.

7. **Descriptive Variable Names**: Use descriptive names for variables and functions to make the code self-documenting.

   let userFirstName = 'John';

   function updateUserProfile() { ... }

8. **Using Template Literals for Dynamic HTML**: Use template literals for creating dynamic HTML content.

   const userName = 'John';

   const userCard = `<div class="user-card">${userName}</div>`;

9. **Avoid Inline Styles**: Avoid using inline styles in JavaScript. Instead, add or remove CSS classes.

   this.$element.classList.add('active');

10. **Event Delegation**: Use event delegation to handle events efficiently, especially for dynamically added elements.

    document.body.addEventListener('click', function(event) {

      if (event.target.matches('.button')) {

    â€‹    // Handle button click

      }

    });

Yes, there are several articles and discussions on the internet that explore the pros and cons of using `$` to prefix variables, especially those related to DOM elements or jQuery objects. Here are a few key points often discussed:

### Pros:

1. **Readability**: Prefixing variables with `$` makes it immediately clear that the variable is a reference to a DOM element or a jQuery object, improving code readability.
2. **Consistency**: It provides a consistent way to identify UI-related variables, which can be particularly useful in larger codebases or when working in teams.
3. **Avoiding Conflicts**: It helps avoid naming conflicts with other variables that are not related to the DOM or jQuery.
4. **Historical Context**: This convention has historical roots in jQuery, where `$` is used as an alias for the jQuery function, making it a familiar practice for many developers.

### Cons:

1. **Overuse**: Overusing the `$` prefix can lead to cluttered code, especially if applied to too many variables unnecessarily.
2. **Modern Practices**: With the decline in jQuery usage and the rise of modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, the `$` prefix convention is less relevant and less commonly used.
3. **Context-Specific**: The `$` prefix is context-specific and may not be intuitive for developers who are not familiar with this convention, potentially leading to confusion.
4. **Inconsistency**: If not applied consistently across a codebase, it can lead to confusion and reduce the benefits of using the convention.
